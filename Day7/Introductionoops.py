# Java
# class , object in java are must
# Python - structured + object oriented
# oops (object oriented programming concepts)
# --------
# class
# object
# inheritenace
#  Polymorphism
#
# class           object
#  Employee --> JOhn,scott,marry etc....
#  Animal  --> Dog, Horse, Elephant etc....

# class --> collection of variables(attributes) & methods(behaviour)
#class is blue print
#Logical entity
#Does not occupy space in the memory
#
# object --> object is an instance of class
# physical entity
# occupy certain amount space in the memory

# For one class we can create multiple objects.
# objects are independent....

# Function  vs Method
# --------------------
# Function --> we can create without class.
# Method --> creates in side the class.

# 2 types of methods we can define within the class...
#
# 1) instance method (we can call through object)
# 2) static method (we can directly call using class)


# annotation @staticmethod


# Global variables
# Class variables
# Local variables
